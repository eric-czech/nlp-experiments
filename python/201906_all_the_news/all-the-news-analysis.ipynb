[the company] is moving forward smoothly on related  fundraising plans, and we will make an announcement at an  appropriate time,” Jia said at a business forum in Beijing Media reports in November said LeEco had defaulted on payments to  its suppliers amid a cash crunch which cast doubt on its plan to  produce an electric car, a dream that Jia has heavily invested  in Jia said the plan was going ahead and LeEco will announce  substantial progress on its production plant, in Deqing county in  eastern China’s Zhejiang province, by the end of this month The company announced in August a plan to invest 12 billion yuan  in an electric car factory capable of making 400,000 cars a year  by 2018 LeEco is also in partnership to make electric cars in the US with  electric car start-up Faraday Future, which was also said to have  halted construction of its Nevada factory We and our strategic partner FF [Faraday Future] will  demonstrate the revolutionary achievement we have made soon,” Jia  said LeEco has burned through more than 10 billion yuan on its car  investment, putting pressure on the company which is having  difficulty raising cash Further questions were raised after LeEco’s Shenzhen-listed unit,  Leshi Internet Information and Technology Corp, halted trading on  December 7 The suspension came after the company’s share fell to as low as  35.01 yuan over mounting concerns that staff would be laid off  \n",
